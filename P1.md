# C Programming Problem: Weighted Final Score Evaluation System

### Description
A university wants to implement a **weighted final score evaluation system** for its students.  
Each student’s final score must be calculated from assignment, exam, and attendance, with different weights.  
You are asked to create a C program that accepts a student’s details, performs the calculation, and displays the results in a specified format.  

---

### Input
Your program must accept five inputs from the keyboard:

1. **Student Registration Number (NRP):** An integer used for student identification.  
2. **Assignment Score:** A floating-point number.  
3. **Midterm Exam Score (UTS):** A floating-point number.  
4. **Final Exam Score (UAS):** A floating-point number.  
5. **Attendance Percentage:** A floating-point number between `0.0` and `100.0`.  

---

### Calculations
The program must calculate the **Final Score** using the following formula:  

- ExamAverage = (UTS + UAS) / 2
- FinalScore = (0.25 * Assignment) + (0.05 * Attendance) + (0.70 * ExamAverage)

---

### Output
The program must display the following results to the screen using `printf()`, with the specified format and precision, and use escape sequences for layout:

1. **NRP Mahasiswa:** Displayed as an integer.  
2. **Assignment Score:** Displayed with two decimal places.  
3. **Midterm Score:** Displayed with two decimal places.  
4. **Final Exam Score:** Displayed with two decimal places.  
5. **Attendance Percentage:** Displayed with two decimal places followed by a percent symbol (`%`).  
6. **Final Score:** Displayed with two decimal places.
